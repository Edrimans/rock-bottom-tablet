            Stone-washed jeans have been a staple in casual fashion for decades, valued for their soft, worn-in feel and
            distinct faded appearance. Unlike raw or untreated denim, which starts out stiff and dark, stone-washed
            jeans undergo a special process that gives them a more comfortable, relaxed fit and a broken-in look right
            from the start. This unique finishing technique is what sets stone-washed jeans apart and makes them a
            beloved choice for people who want the rugged, casual look of denim without the lengthy break-in period. The
            term &#34;stone-washed&#34; refers to the process of washing denim fabric with actual stones—typically
            pumice stones. <br /><br />During this process, the jeans are placed in large industrial washing machines
            along with the stones. As the machine agitates, the stones rub against the fabric, physically wearing down
            the surface of the denim. This abrasion lightens the fabric and gives it a faded, distressed look that
            varies from one pair of jeans to another. The longer the jeans are tumbled with the stones, the more faded
            and worn they become. This process not only affects the appearance of the jeans but also their texture. Raw
            denim can be quite stiff when new, requiring weeks or even months of wear before it begins to soften and
            conform to the wearer’s body.<br /><br />Stone washing speeds up this process, resulting in jeans that are
            soft and comfortable from the first time you put them on. This makes stone-washed jeans a popular choice for
            people who value comfort and ease of movement in their everyday wear. Stone washing was first popularized in
            the 1960s and 1970s as part of the growing trend for casual, lived-in styles. Denim, long associated with
            workwear and durability, began to take on a new identity as a fashion statement. People no longer wanted
            their jeans to look stiff and brand new; instead, they preferred a relaxed, worn look that spoke of
            character and individuality.
